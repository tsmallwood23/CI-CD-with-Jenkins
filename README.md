Practice using Jenkins to create an entire CI/CD pipeline. 

I used different branches to practice integrating it with different tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc. Eventually adding up to an entire CI/CD pipeline.

The app used for the practice was not written by me. It is courtery of Nana's bootcamp https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp
